# Class Rectangle
This project is to build a class Rectangle in python. The class has two private instance attributes:
- `width`: width of the rectangle
- `height`: height of the rectangle

and two public class attributes:
- `number_of_instances`: number of instances instanciated, initialized to `0`
- `print_symbol`: symbol used to print the rectangle, initialized to `#`

File 0 ~ 9 shows step-by-step how the class is built.
